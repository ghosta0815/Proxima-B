## Welcome to Proxima-B
### Purpose of this Project
This project is a test to better understand software development methods and to practice good coding (based on the guidelines described by Code Complete 2 by Steve McConnel)

## What is Proxima-B
The general Idea of this project is based on the game Aurora4X by Steve Walmsley (see: http://aurorawiki.pentarch.org/) and the fan-recreation attempt of Pulsar4X here at Github.
